## Setup

Run the following commands to setup the database before starting :)

1. npm run db:create
2. npm run tables:create

This last step is optional but you can do this if you'd like to start using your app with some data already in it.

Please do this only if you haven't already started using the app! Or the data will be messed up. And please only do this once. :P

3. npm run data:seed
